This is a place where creatures of your nightmares will alive.  Ugly but  pretty
useful templates, ideas, methods will be dropped in this pit for eternal  battle

Most of these examples are written in c because  i  have  not  practice  at  any
another programming language. 

## what if you need object orientied programming in c...

Some people says what C++ is a C but with extra features which  reduce  routine.
Also C is a Turing-full language so it's can apply any algorythm which  you  can
imagine.  Let's try to find out how we can apply  object  orientied  programming
using c.

First of all let's define what we will mean when we speak about OOP.  I know two
ways: 
1) program consists of objects, objects consists of data and algorhytms, objects
interacts with another objects using messages
2) programs consists of objects, which organized in parenthesis  hierarchy,  OOP
drives encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.

C++ applied first statement with some conventions:
1) calling method is message which object received
2) reading or writing data is message which object received

Sounds weird, but C++ apply OOP because these conventions.  And that's why  Alan
Kay says, what it is not that OOP he developed.  But today we will discuss about
C++ OOP infrastructure.

What is class in C++?  Class is a structure with fields.  Fields  has  it's  own
access type.  All classes have constructors and destructors,  which  prepare  or
destroy data.
